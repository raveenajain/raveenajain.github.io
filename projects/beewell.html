        My team's idea: To create a mobile app that would help our target audience
        (young adults) maintain a healthier lifestyle.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Project Proposal </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        For the final project of my undergraduate Human Computer Interaction class,
        a partner and I had to develop an application of our choice. After some
        brainstorming, we, as young adults who rarely slept, skipped meals, and drank
        coffee instead of water, decided to create an app that would help young
        adults just like us take better care of themselves. However, we wanted to
        create something that went beyond just offering basic reminders to eat,
        sleep, and drink water. We proposed a more engaging and motivational experience
        that would have users take care of an avatar, who acted as an extension of
        the user, to remind them to also care for themselves. Our process is detailed
        below, but <i><a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/raveenajain/BeeWell">
        the final prototype can be found here on Github</a></i>. The following are
        some quick sketches I made to help us get the basics of our idea across
        for our proposal.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Conceptual Design </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        After submitting our project proposal, we created Metaphors and
        Scenarios for the User and for our main tasks of Sleeping, Eating, and
        Drinking Water. We then separately found our visual inspiration and had
        a meeting to discuss where we saw this design going, focusing on where our
        ideas overlapped as well as any points we each felt were important. This
        allowed us to move forward on the same page.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Sketches and Storyboarding </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Because of the smaller scope of this project as well as our more specific
        target audience, we created only a Primary Persona. We then developed our
        Scenarios, empathizing with that persona, and used those deliverables as
        inspiration as we explored potential ideas by each sketching a proposed
        layout for our most important screen (i.e. where the user gives their avatar
        food, water, and tells it to sleep).

      </div>

      <div class="page-text">
        We then worked together to combine our ideas into one to create screens for
        The Studio Apartment, showing a confirmation pop-up and displaying a generic
        dialogue box as we knew those would evolve into core features. We also developed
        a rough storyboard showcasing how our app could successfully remind someone
        to care for an avatar and themselves as a way of "selling" our idea and its
        effectiveness to our professor.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Paper Prototyping and Low-Fidelity Testing </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        With a clearer idea of our screens and core features, we created paper prototypes
        and split up to perform in-person, moderated, Think Aloud tests with potential
        users. Because of our tight timeline, and considering the minimalist functionality
        associated with this app, using low-fidelity prototypes were an effective
        and efficient way of testing out our initial ideas.

      </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Before performing these tests, we created tasks to cover our key functionalities: <br>
        1. Move through the welcome form screens, enter values for how much sleep
        you want to get and how much food and water you want to eat and drink. <br>
        2. Give your avatar water. <br>
        3. Change the number of hours of sleep you want to get to 9 hours. <br>
        4. Feed your avatar. <br>
        We each took notes during testing and reconvened to, together, establish
        the following key takeaways:

      <div class="page-sub-header"> High-Fidelity, Clickable Prototype </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        As we were approaching our final round of testing, we felt it would be beneficial
        to have users be able to interact with a more finished product on an actual phone.
        As our focus was on users' needs, we took the feedback from our initial testing
        to make changes as we created a high-fidelity prototype. As required by the
        course, we had to make this prototype accessible via a web browser (and not
        using prototyping software such as Figma), so we coded it in JavaScript,
        HTML, and CSS.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Heuristic Evaluations and User Testing </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        In order to iteratively improve our product, we performed more user tests as
        well as heuristic evaluations (the "experts" were our peers from the course
        which meant we were also able to act as "experts" and perform heuristic evaluations
        for other apps). From these tests and evaluations, we prioritized our results
        and made changes to our high-fidelity prototype. The severity of our issues
        was mainly determined by frequency, criticality, and ease of use. However,
        when actually making changes, we did have to consider our deadline and weigh
        how long it would take to make a change with that change's overall impact.
        We also took note of positives to make sure that any adjustments we did make
        did not impact what users liked about our app.
