      To Do App

        To start learning React, I decided to go the classic route and make a To
        Do Application. As I began this project after taking a Human Computer Interaction
        course, and with a budding interest in Product Design, I figured it would
        be a good idea to create
        <i><a class="text-link" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/O2vfZ9c17rfELeFYW0cdz2/todoapp?node-id=2%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A2">
          a clickable prototype on Figma</a></i> before moving on to building
        the web app. Below is a demo video, however
        <i><a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/raveenajain/todoapp">
          the code as well as instructions on how to download and use the app can be found on Github</a></i>.
      </div>

        As this app is meant to be minimal, the main functionality centers around
        adding new tasks that can be checked and unchecked. However, I decided that
        being able to color code and change themes would be a nice addition, especially
        considering similar functionalities are common in organizational apps. When
        deciding on color schemes, I used my browser's developer tools to make sure
        that colors (within each theme) were distinct enough for users who might
        need/prefer more contrast or be colorblind. I also added the lines theme
        for accessibility in case the contrasting colors were not enough. And finally,
        I considered error handling by highlighting the textbox in red if a user
        tries to add an empty task.
