        To start learning React, I decided to go the classic route and make a To
        Do Application. As this app is meant to be minimal, the main functionality
        centers around adding new tasks that can be checked and unchecked. However,
        I decided that being able to color code and change themes would be a nice addition,
        especially considering similar functionalities are common in organizational
        apps. When deciding on color schemes, I used my browser's developer tools
        to make sure that colors (within each theme) were distinct enough for users
        who might need/prefer more contrast or be colorblind. I also added the lines
        theme for accessibility in case the contrasting colors were not enough. And
        finally, I considered error handling by highlighting the textbox in red if
        a user tries to add an empty task.
        <br>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Process </div>
        The first step, after setting up the React App, was to create the basic
        functionality i.e. adding items to the list and then checking and unchecking
        any items. After making sure the styling of the list and pop-up modal was
        expected, the ability to modify the color schemes was added. I then tested
        the application, thinking of edge cases and potential ways of breaking the
        app; this is when I added the feature that alerts users if they try and
        add an empty task.

        I began this project after taking a Human Computer Interaction
        course during my last undergraduate semester and so, with a budding interest
        in Product Design, I figured it would be a good idea to create
        <i><a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/O2vfZ9c17rfELeFYW0cdz2/todoapp?node-id=2%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A2">
          a clickable prototype on Figma</a></i> before moving on to building
        the web app. Below is a demo video, however
