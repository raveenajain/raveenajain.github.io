      Evaluation of Charity Website

        To evaluate a website with target users in order to create a rainbow

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Evaluating the Live Website </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        For my Evaluating Interactive Systems class, I was given a brief that I
        then used to set specific goals. I then established that the following steps
        would be the best way for me to gather the information needed to evaluate
        the website:
        <br>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> The Script </div>
        Writing a script (of tasks), loosely framed by a scenario, both made
        sure users reached the areas of the website the brief wanted to address
        and made the evaluation feel more realistic by giving users purpose.
        <br>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Questionnaires </div>
        To find if the users struggled while using the site, the Single Ease Question
        (SEQ) was asked after certain tasks. Qualtrics was used to write and send
        out a SUPR-Q questionnaire to each participant at the end of their interview
        as elements related to ease of use, trust, and appearance were relevant to
        the goals.
        <br>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Testing Sessions </div>
        In total, I held five remote, moderated sessions (in addition to a pilot session)
        and used a classic Think Aloud protocol. Due to limited resources, these sessions
        had to be remote. However, the moderation and protocol were chosen as it
        was important to understand what the users were feeling in addition to "the
        why" behind their decisions.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> The Results </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        <div class="page-text-heading" style="padding-top: 0px;"> Coding the Data </div>
        Transcripts from each participant were summarized and coded. Essentially,
        three codes were used to note whether a comment was positive, something the
        user would have liked to have or have been able to do, or was a negative
        (e.g. triggering feelings of annoyance or frustration).
        <br>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Qualitative and Quantitative Data </div>
        The qualitative data, alongside the quantitative data from the questionnaires,
        was used to answer each requirement from the brief (in the form of a short
        summary). Because of the small number of participants, on its own, the quantitative
        data would not have been strong enough. So it was used to reinforce conclusions
        drawn from the qualitative findings.
        <br>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Deliverables </div>
        This data was then translated to the design recommendations. The main portion
        of the report required four main design recommendations ranked by severity
        (the ranking system was based on Dumash and Redish’s work as they considered
        “a global versus local dimension to the problem”). However, before writing
        these main recommendations, a rainbow spreadsheet was created which helped
        me discover similarities in the issues participants ran into. I then created
        another spreadsheet, not only to further group and organize each issue by
        goal, but to clarify what effects these issues would have on the goals, to
        rank them by severity, and to offer more potential re-design recommendations.
