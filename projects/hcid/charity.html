        To evaluate a website with target users in order to create a rainbow

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Evaluating the Live Website </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        For my Evaluating Interactive Systems class, I was given a brief that I
        then used to set specific goals. I then established that the following steps
        would be the best way for me to gather the information needed to evaluate
        the website:
        <br>
        - writing a script (of tasks), loosely framed by a scenario to both make
        sure users reached the areas of the website the brief wanted to address
        and to make the evaluation feel more realistic by giving users purpose
        <br>
        - adding the use of the Single Ease Question (SEQ) after certain
        tasks
        <br>
        - using Qualtrics to write and send out a SUPR-Q questionnaire to each participant
        as elements related to ease of use, trust, and appearance were relevant
        to the goals
        <br>
        </br>
        In total, I held five remote, moderated sessions (in addition to a pilot session)
        and used a classic Think Aloud protocol. Due to limited resources, these sessions
        had to be remote; however, the moderation and protocol were chosen as it
        was important to understand what the users were feeling in addition to "the
        why" behind their decisions.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Developing the Results </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Transcripts from each participant were summarized and coded and that qualitative
        data, alongside the quantitative data from the questionnaires, were used to
        answer each requirement from the brief (in the form of a short summary).
        <br>
        </br>
        This data was also used to develop the design recommendations. The main portion
        of the report required four main design recommendations ranked by severity
        (the ranking system was based on Dumash and Redish’s work as they considered
        “a global versus local dimension to the problem”). However, before writing
        these main recommendations, a rainbow spreadsheet was created which helped
        me discover similarities in the issues participants ran into. I then created
        another spreadsheet, not only to further group and organize each issue by
        goal, but to clarify what effects these issues would have on the goals, to
        rank them by severity, and to offer more potential re-design recommendations.
