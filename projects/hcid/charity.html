      Evaluation of Charity Website

      <div class="page-text">
        For my Evaluating Interactive Systems class, I was tasked with conducting
        an evaluation of a given charity website and then reporting my results.
        Working off of the provided brief, I established specific goals before moving
        on to writing a script (of tasks), loosely framed by a scenario. As elements
        related to ease of use, trust, and appearance were relevant to the goals,
        I also incorporated the use of the Single Ease Question (SEQ) after certain
        tasks and sent out a SUPR-Q questionnaire to each participant. In total,
        I held five remote, moderated sessions (in addition to a pilot session)
        using a classic Think Aloud protocol. Due to limited resources, these sessions
        had to be remote; however, the moderation and protocol were chosen as it
        was important to understand what the users were feeling in addition to "the
        why" behind their decisions.
        <br>
        </br>
        Transcripts from each participant were summarized and coded and that qualitative
        data, alongside the quantitative data from the questionnaires, were used to
        answer each requirement from the brief (in the form of a brief summary).
        This data was also used to develop design recommendations. The main portion
        of the report required four main design recommendations, which were ranked
        by severity (which was based on Dumash and Redish’s work as they considered
        “a global versus local dimension to the problem”). However, before writing
        these main recommendations, I created a rainbow spreadsheet in order to discover
        overlaps in the issues participants ran into. I then created another spreadsheet,
        not only to further condense and organize each issue by goal, but to clarify
        what effects these issues would have on the goal and to offer a potential
        redesign recommendation.
