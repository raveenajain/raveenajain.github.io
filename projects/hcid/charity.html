              For my Evaluating Interactive Systems class, I established which methods would be best for me to use to gather the information I believed I would need.
              My first step, however, was expanding upon the brief to set the following specific goals:
              <div class=img-row>
                <img src="../../images/charity/goals.png" style="width: 95%;" alt="screenshot of the chart of goals from my report">

            <div class="small-heading content-header-row">Script</div>
            <div class="page-text">
              Writing a script (of tasks), loosely framed by a scenario, both made sure users reached the areas of the website the brief wanted to address and made the evaluation feel more realistic by giving users purpose.
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- consent forms -->
          <div class="content-row" id="consent">

            <div class="page-text">
              I wrote a consent form and required each participant to read, sign, and return the form before their session.

            <div class="page-text">
              To find if users struggled while using the site, the Single Ease Question (SEQ) was asked after certain tasks.
              A SUPR-Q questionnaire was sent out to each participant via Qualtrics at the end of their interview as elements related to ease of use, trust, and appearance were relevant to the brief/goals.
              The following is the result of the SUPR-Q questionnaire as listed in my report:
              <div class=img-row>
                <img src="../../images/charity/suprq.png" style="width: 95%;" alt="screenshot of the table listing the results of the suprq by question and participant from my report">

            <div class="small-heading content-header-row">Testing Sessions</div>
            <div class="page-text">
              In total, I held 5 remote, moderated sessions (in addition to a pilot session) and used a classic Think Aloud protocol.
              Due to limited resources, these sessions had to be remote.
              However, the moderation and protocol were chosen as it was important to understand what the users were feeling in addition to "the why" behind their decisions.

            <div class="page-text">
              Transcripts from each participant were summarized and coded.
              I established 3 codes to note whether a comment was positive, something the user would have liked to have or have been able to do, or was negative (e.g. triggering feelings of annoyance or frustration).

            <div class="small-heading content-header-row">Using Qualitative and Quantitative Data</div>
            <div class="page-text">
              The qualitative data, alongside the quantitative data from the questionnaires, was used to answer each requirement from the brief (in the form of a short summary).
              Because of the small number of participants, on its own, the quantitative data would not have been strong enough.
              So it was used to reinforce conclusions drawn from the qualitative findings.

          <!-- rainbow spreadsheet -->
          <div class="content-row" id="spreadsheet">
            <div class="small-heading content-header-row">Rainbow Spreadsheet</div>
            <div class="page-text">
              Before writing the design recommendations, I created a rainbow spreadsheet to help me discover where the issues participants ran into overlapped.
              <div class=img-row>
                <img src="../../images/charity/rainbow.png" style="width: 80%;" alt="screenshot of a snippet of the rainbow spreadsheet from my report">
              </div>
              <br>
              I then created another spreadsheet to further group and organize each issue by goal, to clarify what effects these issues would have on the goals,
              to rank them by severity, and to offer more potential re-design recommendations.

          <!-- design recommendations -->

            <div class="small-heading content-header-row">Design Recommendations</div>
            <div class="page-text">
              This data was translated to design recommendations.
              The main portion of the report required 4 main design recommendations ranked by severity.
              I chose to base my ranking system on Dumash and Redish’s work as they considered “a global versus local dimension to the problem.”
              The following is an example of one of the recommendations from my report:
