      According to the Theogony of Hesiod, they were the twelve children of the <a
        href="primordials.html">Primordial</a> parents Uranus and Gaia. The Titans were the former gods: the
      generation of gods preceding the <a href="olympians.html">Olympians</a>. They were overthrown as part of the
      Greek succession myth, which tells how Cronus seized power from his father Uranus and ruled the cosmos with his
      fellow Titans before being in turn defeated and replaced as the ruling pantheon of gods by Zeus and the <a
        href="olympians.html">Olympians</a> in a ten-year war called "the Titanomachy". As the Titans were the
      banished gods, who were no longer part of the upper world, they dwelt underground in Tartarus, and as such, they
      may have been thought of as "gods of the underworld".
      <br></br>
      Passages in a section of the Iliad called the Deception of Zeus suggest the possibility that Homer knew of a
      tradition in which Oceanus and Tethys (rather than Uranus and Gaia, as in Hesiod) were the parents of the Titans.
      Plato, in his Timaeus, provides a genealogy (probably Orphic) which perhaps reflected an attempt to reconcile this
      apparent divergence between Homer and Hesiod, with Uranus and Gaia as the parents of Oceanus and Tethys, and
      Oceanus and Tethys as the parents of Cronus and Rhea "and all that go with them", plus Phorcys.

        <article>
          Cronus was the youngest son of Uranus and Gaea, the leader of the first generation of Titans, and, for a brief
          period, the ruler of all gods and men. He successfully led the rebellion against his father, but soon grew as
          tyrannical as him, imprisoning both the Cyclops and the Hecatoncheires, and swallowing all of his children,
          save the last son; eventually, this child – Zeus – would be the one to overthrow him and lock him away in
          Tartarus. Because his name was often confused with the Greek word for time, Chronos, Cronus was often depicted
          as Old Father Time, with whom, conveniently, he did share few characteristics: mercilessness, a beard, and a
          scythe. In fact, in many cases, the two are visually indistinguishable.
          <br></br>
          After seizing power, Cronus married his sister Rhea and, for a while, everything seemed all but perfect.
          However, at some point, Cronus violently and dramatically changed his ways. Fearing rebellion, he imprisoned
          both the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires in Tartarus and set the dragoness Campe to guard them. Alarmed by a
          prophecy saying that he would be overthrown by one of his children, he started swallowing them all, one by
          one. Eventually deposed from the throne, Cronus either escaped to Latium (modern Lazio) or was imprisoned in
          Tartarus with the rest of the Titans. In time, he was promoted to be the ruler of the Islands of the Blessed,
          a heaven-like abode, where the souls of only the greatest heroes lived after their earthly deaths.

        <article>
          Rhea is a mother goddess, the Titaness daughter of the earth goddess Gaia and the sky god Uranus, himself a
          son of Gaia. She is the older sister of Cronus, who was also her consort, and the mother of the five eldest <a
            href="olympians.html">Olympian</a> gods Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Poseidon and Zeus; and Hades, king of
          the Underworld. When Rhea had her sixth and final child, Zeus, she spirited him away and hid him in Crete,
          giving Cronus a rock to swallow instead, thus saving her youngest son who would go on to challenge his
          father's rule and rescue the rest of his siblings. Following Zeus' defeat of Cronus and the rise of the <a
            href="olympians.html">Olympian</a> gods into power, Rhea withdraws her role as the queen of the gods
          to become a supporting figure on Mount Olympus. Rhea had "no strong local cult or identifiable activity under
          her control". She was originally worshiped on the island of Crete, identified in mythology as the site of
          Zeus' infancy and upbringing.
          <br></br>
          Rhea raised another one of her grandsons, Dionysus, after the fiery death of his mother, the mortal princess
          Semele. Later on she went on to heal Dionysus' raging madness, which had been inflicted on him by the jealous
          Hera, causing him to wander around aimlessly for some time. According to Bacchylides, it was Rhea herself who
          restored Pelops to life after his father Tantalus cut him down.
