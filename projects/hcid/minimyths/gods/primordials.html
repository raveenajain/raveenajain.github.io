      The primordial deities were the first generation of gods and goddesses to emerge after the creation of the cosmos.
      These deities represented the fundamental forces and physical foundations of the world and were generally not
      actively worshipped, as they, for the most part, were not given human characteristics; they were instead
      personifications of places or abstract concepts. Hesiod, in his Theogony, which could be considered the "standard"
      creation myth of Greek mythology, considers the first beings (after Chaos) to be Gaia, Tartarus, Eros and Nyx.
      Gaia and Uranus in turn gave birth to the <a href="titans.html">Titans</a>, and the Cyclopes. Scholars dispute
      the meaning of the primordial deities in the poems of Homer and Hesiod. Since the primordials give birth to the <a
        href="titans.html">Titans</a>, and the <a href="titans.html">Titans</a> give birth to the <a
        href="olympians.html">Olympians</a>, one way of interpreting the primordial gods is as the deepest and most
      fundamental nature of the cosmos.

        <article>
          Gaia is the personification of the Earth and the ancestral mother of all life. She was worshiped under the
          epithet "Anesidora", which means "giver of gifts". Gaia is the mother of Uranus (the sky), from whose sexual
          union she bore the <a href="titans.html">Titans</a> (themselves parents of many of the <a
            href="olympians.html">Olympian</a> gods), the Cyclopes, and the Giants; as well as of Pontus (the sea),
          from whose union she bore the primordial sea gods.
          <br></br>
          Hesiod's Theogony tells how, after Chaos, "wide-bosomed" Gaia (Earth) arose to be the everlasting seat of the
          immortals who possess Olympus above. And after Gaia came "dim Tartarus in the depth of the wide-pathed Earth",
          and next Eros the god of love. Hesiod goes on to say that Gaia brought forth her equal Uranus (Heaven, Sky) to
          "cover her on every side". Gaia also bore the Ourea (Mountains), and Pontus (Sea), "without sweet union of
          love" (i.e., with no father).
          <br><br>
          Gaia took part in the battles known as the Titanomachy. Because Cronus had learned from Gaia and Uranus that
          he was destined to be overthrown by one of his children, he swallowed each of the children born to him by his
          <a href="titans.html">Titan</a> older sister, Rhea. But when Rhea was pregnant with her youngest child,
          Zeus, she sought help from Gaia and Uranus. When Zeus was born, Rhea gave Cronus a stone wrapped in
          swaddling-clothes in his place, which Cronus swallowed, and Gaia took the child into her care. With the help
          of Gaia's advice, Zeus defeated the <a href="titans.html">Titans</a> But afterwards, Gaia, in union with
          Tartarus, bore the youngest of her sons Typhon, who would be the last challenge to the authority of Zeus.

        <article>
          Uranus is the personification of the sky and one of the Greek primordial deities. According to Hesiod, Uranus
          was the son and husband of Gaia (Earth), with whom he fathered the first generation of <a
            href="titans.html">Titans</a>. However, no cult addressed directly to Uranus survived into Classical
          times, and Uranus does not appear among the usual themes of Greek painted pottery. With Gaia, Uranus produced
          eighteen children: the twelve <a href="titans.html">Titans</a>, the three Cyclopes, and the three
          Hecatoncheires (Hundred-Handers), but hating them, he hid them away somewhere inside Gaia. Angry and in
          distress, Gaia fashioned a sickle made of adamant and urged her children to punish their father.
          <br></br>
          Other sources give other genealogies. In the lost epic poem the Titanomachy, Uranus was apparently the son of
          Aether, while according to others Uranus was the son of one "Acmon". According to Orphic texts, Uranus (along
          with Gaia) was the offspring of Nyx (Night) and Phanes. The poet Sappho (c. 630 â€“ c. 570 BC), was said to have
          made Uranus the father of Eros, by either Gaia, according one source, or Aphrodite, according to another.
