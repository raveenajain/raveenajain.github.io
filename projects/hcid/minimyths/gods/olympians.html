    <p class="gods-main-summary">
      The Twelve Olympians were the principal deities of Greek mythology. Their name derives from the fact that they
      lived on Mount Olympus, a medium-sized mountain in northern Greece. With Zeus as their king, they were worshiped
      as the rulers of the cosmos. However, not all sources agreed on the identities of the Twelve Olympians. In some
      traditions, the domestic goddess Hestia, one of the first generation of Olympians, gave up her seat to Dionysus
      when he became a god. Because of this, there are actually thirteen gods who were counted.
      <br></br>
      The first generation of Olympians were children of the <a href="titans.html">Titans</a> Cronus and Rhea,
      themselves early rulers of the cosmos. Eventually, Zeus and his siblings overthrew the <a
        href="titans.html">Titans</a> and made themselves the new gods. They continued to rule undefeated (though
      not unchallenged) for the remainder of the Greek mythical period. The second generation of Olympians were mostly
      offspring of Zeus and his siblings. They included Athena, goddess of wisdom, Ares, god of war, and the twins
      Apollo and Artemis.

          Artemis is the goddess of wild animals, the hunt, and vegetation and of chastity and childbirth. She was the
          daughter of Zeus and Leto and the twin sister of Apollo. Among the rural populace, Artemis was the favourite
          goddess. Her character and function varied greatly from place to place, but, apparently, behind all forms lay
          the goddess of wild nature, who danced, usually accompanied by nymphs, in mountains, forests, and marshes.
          Artemis embodied the sportsman’s ideal, so besides killing game she also protected it, especially the young.
          <br></br>
          The wrath of Artemis was proverbial, for to it myth attributed wild nature’s hostility to humans. Yet Greek
          sculpture avoided Artemis’s unpitying anger as a motif. In fact, the goddess herself did not become popular as
          a subject in the great sculptural schools until the relatively gentle 4th-century-bce spirit prevailed.

        <article>
          Athena is associated with wisdom, warfare, and handicraft and was regarded as the patron and protectress of
          various cities across Greece, particularly the city of Athens, from which she most likely received her name.
          Her major symbols include owls, olive trees, snakes, and the Gorgoneion. In art, she is generally depicted
          wearing a helmet and holding a spear. She was also a warrior goddess, and was believed to lead soldiers into
          battle as Athena Promachos. Her main festival in Athens was the Panathenaia, which was celebrated during the
          month of Hekatombaion in midsummer and was the most important festival on the Athenian calendar.
          <br></br>
          Athena was believed to have been born from the forehead of her father Zeus. In some versions of the story,
          Athena has no mother. Along with Aphrodite and Hera, Athena was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted
          in the beginning of the Trojan War. She plays an active role in the Iliad, in which she assists the Achaeans
          and, in the <a href="../stories/odyssey.html"> Odyssey</a>, she is the divine counselor to Odysseus. In the
          later writings of the Roman poet Ovid, Athena was said to have competed against the mortal Arachne in a
          weaving competition, afterward transforming Arachne into the first spider.

        <article>
          Zeus is the sky and thunder god who rules as king of the gods on Mount Olympus. Zeus is the child of Cronus
          and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required
          disgorging from Cronus's stomach; in most traditions, he is married to Hera. He was respected as an allfather
          who was chief of the gods and assigned roles to the others: "Even the gods who are not his natural children
          address him as Father, and all the gods rise in his presence.
          <br></br>
          According to the Theogony, after Zeus reaches manhood, Cronus is made to disgorge the five children and the
          stone "by the stratagems of Gaia, but also by the skills and strength of Zeus", presumably in reverse order,
          vomiting out the stone first, then each of the five children in the opposite order to swallowing. Zeus then
          sets up the stone at Delphi, so that it may act as "a sign thenceforth and a marvel to mortal men". Zeus next
          frees the Cyclopes, who, in return, and out of gratitude, give him his thunderbolt, which had previously been
          hidden by Gaia. Then begins the Titanomachy, the war between the Olympians, led by Zeus, and the <a
            href="titans.html">Titans</a>, led by Cronus, for control of the universe. According to the Iliad,
          after the battle with the <a href="titans.html">Titans</a>, Zeus shares the world with his brothers,
          Poseidon and Hades, by drawing lots: Zeus receives the sky, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld, with
          the earth and Olympus remaining common ground.
