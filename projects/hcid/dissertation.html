      <div class="page-sub-header"> Chapter 2 - Very, Very Brief Context </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Immersion is not a new or unpopular idea. However, definitions vary depending
        on context. There are also a number of existing models of immersion, with
        different concepts that may overlap or feed into one another. Despite these
        differences, it is accepted that there are different levels of immersion;
        however, there is no consensus on how those levels are distinguished. Some
        common themes deal with engagement of the senses, narrative, presence, and
        creating a "world."
        <br></br>
        Interactive elements are common in immersive spaces. A popular example is
        the wands in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (a Universal Theme Park)
        that allows guests to "perform" spells.

      <div class="page-text">
        <div class="page-text-heading" style="padding-top: 0px;"> Literature Analysis </div>
        Google Scholar and ACM were used to find the literature. Studies that were
        too general and/or looked at relevant environments or technology, like VR,
        but did not tie the research back to immersion or the effects of interactivity
        were rejected. Each saved paper was read and quotes were taken that pertained
        to definitions [RQ1], levels [RQ1.1], and qualities of immersion/immersive
        environments and interactive technology [RQ2/RQ3]. Quotes that defined immersion
        or interactivity, mentioned or implied levels of immersion, touched on something
        the authors thought contributed to or affected immersion or interactivity,
        and/or quotes that mentioned the effects of interactive technology on users
        or the environment were considered relevant. For any literature that looked
        to quantify immersion (i.e. questionnaires), because my research was looking
        for qualities of immersion, notes were taken on what aspects of immersion
        the questions pointed to rather than any qualitative results.
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Forum Text Content </div>
        Reddit and DISboards were used to source the Forum Text Content. Four specific
        Subreddits were parsed – r/Themepark, r/disneyparks, r/universalstudios,
        and r/london (was chosen to keep the scope related to immersive experiences
        manageable). The first three Subreddits were more general so comments would
        encompass any of the Universal and/or Disney Parks worldwide. In order to
        keep with the sites Terms and Conditions, a member of City, University of
        London’s ethics committee stated the use of direct quotes was acceptable
        and, to maintain some level of anonymity, no usernames or direct links were
        cited. The goal was to find comments not just saying ‘I find X ride interactive’
        or ‘I find Y land immersive,’ but to use comments that included some sort
        of reasoning as to why those feelings were present.
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Interviews </div>
        Six remote, semi-structured interviews, each lasting roughly 45 minutes,
        were conducted. Potential participants completed a Screener and chosen participants
        were sent Participant Information Sheets and Informed Consent Forms to sign.
        Participants had to meet the following requirements:
        <ul style="margin-top: 0px;">
          <li>Aged 18 or older.</li>
          <li>Fluent or working proficiency in English.</li>
          <li>Have visited any of the Disney and/or Universal Theme Parks within
            2 months of a potentially scheduled interview OR have visited any of
            the Disney and/or Universal Theme Parks within the past 1 year and
            have made at least 11 visits in total by either going at least once
            a year or being a local.</li>
          <li>Have used at least one of the following interactive technologies on their last visit:
            <ul>
              <li>Disney: MagicBand+, Play Disney Parks App (the Star Wars Data Pad and DuckTales World Showcase Adventure), Spiderman WEB Adventure/Web Slingers, Star Wars Smugglers Run, Toy Story Mania, Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spin/Astro Blasters, Monster’s Inc. Ride and Go Seek, Monster’s Inc. Laugh Floor, Turtle Talk with Crush, Galactic Starcruiser.</li>
              <li>Universal: Harry Potter Wands, Power Up Bands, Men In Black: Alien Attack, Mario Kart: Koopa/Bowser’s Challenge.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        While recruitment was attempted on Facebook, DISBoards, Instagram, and LinkedIn,
        all participants were found through Reddit and personal contacts.
      </div>
      <div>
        <img class="page-img" src="../../images/participants.png" alt="brief description of each 6 participants"
          style="width: 65%; float: none;">
      </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        A script was used for the interviews and was informed by the Literatre Review,
        especially the Immersive Experience Questionnaire [IEQ]. The script focused
        on:
        <ul style="margin: 0px;">
          <li>What drew participants to Theme Parks.</li>
          <li>If participants saw Theme Parks as immersive environments.</li>
          <li>How the interactive technology within Theme Parks contributed to or detracted from feelings of immersion.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Data Analysis </div>
        This research took a “content analysis” approach and the main method of
        qualitative analysis was Thematic Analysis where common themes, using an
        inductive approach, were pulled out from each data source as the data determined
        what codes were relevant. Most codes were established by the Literature but,
        as new data was read and new trends formed, new codes were added from both
        other sources. No element of data was restricted to a single parent code;
        this helped inform where codes thematically overlapped. Ideas within different
        codes that supported each other and/or resulted in similar qualities of
        immersion were combined into an overarching theme.

      <div class="page-text">
        <div class="page-text-heading" style="padding-top: 0px;"> Qualities of Immersive Environments </div>
          The data was analyzed and the following list of trends was found. This
          is formatted as the overarching theme and a short, one sentence description.
          <ul>
            <li><i>"The Disney Bubble" - Removal from the Outside World: </i>Guests are transported to a new world that makes them forget about the real one they just came from.</li>
            <li><i>Theming: </i> This is what made a world believable to guests.</li>
            <li><i>Story/Narrative: </i>Guests should feel as though they are a part of the story the world is telling.</li>
            <li><i>Details: </i>These contribute to the story and world and encourage exploration.</li>
            <li><i>Realism and Suspension of Disbelief: </i>Social Realism is “how likely” the detail in the world would “occur in real life;” Perceptual Realism is not about believing the world you were in could actually exist in real life, but that everything about the environment you entered – the buildings, rides, food, employees, interactions, etc. – was realistic to the world being created.</li>
            <li><i>Fields of View: </i>What guests can and cannot see both influence immersion, noting that immersion was decreased if a field of view included details that were not “relevant” to the world.</li>
            <li><i>What Makes a Guest: </i>Existing attachment to an intellectual property, such as being a fan of Star Wars, and nostalgia can positively factor into the emotions a guest feels. The social impact of other guests can be both positive and negative; for example, other guests caused frustrations on a ride where guests were seen as separate from the game while, on a different ride, everyone intentionally had an impact on the overall experience making the influence of others positive.</li>
            <li><i>Performance: </i>Environments themselves were considered a stage and guests and employees were part of the show.</li>
            <li><i>Personalization, Control, and Responding to the Guest: </i>Guests should be placed at the centre of the story where outcomes are directly influenced by their actions.</li>
            <li><i>Resulting Engagement and Involvement: </i>Tied to the previous point, feelings of involvement connected guests to the environment, increasing immersion.</li>
            <li><i>Ways of Interacting: </i>While there are several forms of interactions, regardless of the type, they must be well integrated into the environment. Interactions also increased cognitive engagement, which helped guests suspend disbelief; balance was still needed to limit physical and mental workload.</li>
            <li><i>The Use of Screens: </i>Screens were more effective when they were well integrated into the environment, for example alongside physical effects, and when they were reactive to guests' actions.</li>
            <li><b>In Progress:</b></li>
            <li><i>Barriers and Breakdowns: </i></li>
            <li><i>Physical and Mental Effects and Feelings: </i></li>
            <li><i>Variety, Loyalty, and Newness: </i></li>
          </ul>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Contributions of Interactive Technology to Immersive Environments </div>
        Interactive technology can actively bring guests into the world by creating
        both social and perceptual realism; it can bring to life interactions that
        could not "realistically" or "normally" exist. Interactive technology affects
        immersion through the visibility of its feedback/outputs and creating
        variation through those outputs. It also has the potential to make the guests
        feel as though they are in control.
        <br><br>
        However, if the interactive technology is not intuitive to use, it can raise
        barriers to immersion instead of lowering them. This is also true of one of
        the most widely used forms of interactive technology, smartphones. For one
        participant, using his smartphone made him feel less immersed as he brought
        an element of "the real world into [the] fake world” he was supposedly transported
        to. However, for other participants, the use of their smartphones facilitated
        their day, helping them become more immersed in the world around them.

      <div class="page-text">
        To be immersed in a physical environment is to be transported to a new reality
        that encompasses the visitor, both physically and mentally, though the use
        of physical objects and interactions that engage all the senses.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Levels of Immersion </div>

        <div class="page-text-heading" style="padding-top: 0px;"> Low </div>
        <ul style="margin: 0px;">
          <li>Not all-encompassing; the visitor does not believe that the environment
            could exist as a realistic world of its own.</li>
          <li>Closest to the reality the visitor just came from; they are still
            frequently reminded of that “outside world,” both physically and mentally,
            but will see a few elements that start to build a new reality.</li>
          <li>Minimal sensory input via limited details and interactions; the environment
            does not have the potential to engage all the senses.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Medium </div>
        <ul style="margin: 0px;">
          <li>All-encompassing feelings in most of the space; a majority of the

            realistic world of its own.</li>
          <li>Occasionally reminded of the reality the visitor just came from; this
            could be from external distractions and/or a lack of details within
            the space that attract attention.</li>
          <li>Frequent sensory input via an increased number of details and interactions;
            the environment has the potential to engage multiple senses at once.</li>

            would be most appropriate.</li>
          <li>Establish your audience – visitors have different comfort levels with
            technology, may make repeat visits, and may have pre-existing emotional
            connections with elements that make up the environment.</li>
          <li>Balance the complexity of the environment with the amount of planning
            needed; the experience begins as soon as someone becomes interested
            in visiting your environment – do not make excessive planning necessary
            and create an easy planning experience for those who wish to do so.</li>

            <li>Make the environment something unique that visitors cannot replicate
              on their own (e.g. from their own home) by using interactive technology
              to create interactions that are realistic for that world, even if
              they cannot occur in “real life.”</li>

              using it.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Add detailing that helps visitors understand the world they have entered –
            this should include more obvious details as well as hidden ones that
            could be found through exploration.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Take advantage of the fact that technology is not static; objects

            through the use of physical barriers.</li>
          <ul>

              what visitors interact with and/or the result of those interactions
              should include something physical.</li>
            <li>Use interactive technology to involve the visitors to draw their
              attention to the reality being built and away from the reality they

            that both bring visitors into that story and allow them to have an impact
            on the story and/or world.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Allow visitors to trigger changes in the environment that have a
              lasting effect.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If there’s a Harry Potter spell that lets visitors turn books
                in a shop into birds, as the day goes on, visitors should see more
                and more birds flying around the shop and hear louder bird noises.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Move the narrative along via interactive technology – past interactions
            visitors have should remain relevant for the rest of their visit.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Create a personalized experience and make interactions relevant to
            those directly participating as well as those observing – a change in
            environment should help build the world for anyone who sees it.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Make different interactions, even within the same space, have different
              results based on the visitor using the interactive technology to lower
              the chances of seeing a repeat interaction.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Use interactive technology that captures motion; if a visitor
                makes a big movement, multiple elements change whereas a smaller
                movement only alters one element.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Allow for spontaneity during a visit and build an environment with
            enough space so visitors can choose how to move through it.</li>
          <li>Give visitors the opportunity to set their own goals and/or have access
            to challenges that result in a sense of accomplishment.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Incorporate multiple instances (this can include different ways
              of interacting to suite different types of visitors) of interactive
              technology; this also adds variation and prevents crowding around
              one experience.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A space has five holograms that have conversations and a visitor
                sets a goal to speak to all five.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Integrate the use of smartphones into the theming.</li>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>If a guest is in Animal Kingdom in Disney World, change the interface
                of the Disney planning app to be nature themed; if they are in Tomorrowland
                in Magic Kingdom, make the design more futuristic.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Give feedback to the visitor for every intentional interaction.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Offer engaging reactions based on the visitor’s actions.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A large animatronic could be more suitable to pop out from a hidden
                spot and scare someone momentarily while a character on a screen
                can show more facial emotions and movement when conversing with
                a visitor.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Test any interactive technology used in the environment to make sure
            there is no confusion or usability issues.</li>
          </li>Engage multiple senses at once.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Depending on the theming, interactive technology used, and visitors’
              actions, technology can respond with visual, auditory, olfactory,
              tactile, and/or gustatory actions.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Trigger emotions and create an emotional connection to the space.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Allow guests to interact with objects, characters, or people they
              might not normally be able to or to perform meaningful actions that
              otherwise would not be possible.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Use 3D (portable) projection mapping to bring loved animated
                characters, like Pascal the chameleon from a Disney movie, to
                life in a way that allows for his face to show emotions based
                on visitors’ actions.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ol>
