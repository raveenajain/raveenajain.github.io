        To understand what immersion means, specifically in physical spaces, and
        how design choices and interactive technology impacts the levels and feelings
        of immersion in physical environments.
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Objectives </div>
        <ul style="margin: 0px;">
          <li>[O1] To establish a definition of immersion for physical environments
            and to build upon that definition to classify different levels of
            immersion.</li>
          <li>[O2] To form a set of Design Principles and Guidelines that could
            be used to create immersive physical environments that integrate the
            use of interactive technology.
            <ul>
              <li>[O2.1] Design Principles: high-level and focusing on the overall,
                key elements needed to establish an immersive environment and
                increase the quality and level of immersion.</li>
              <li>[O2.2] Design Guidelines: detailed ways of incorporating interactive
                technology to create an immersive environment and accomplish
                the corresponding Design Principle.</li>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Chapter 2 - Very, Very Brief Context </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Immersion is not a new or unpopular idea. However, definitions vary depending
        on context. There are also a number of existing models of immersion, with
        different concepts that may overlap or feed into one another. Despite these
        differences, it is accepted that there are different levels of immersion;
        however, there is no consensus on how those levels are distinguished. Some
        common themes deal with engagement of the senses, narrative, presence, and
        creating a "world."
        <br></br>
        Interactive elements are common in immersive spaces. A popular example is
        the wands in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (a Universal Theme Park)
        that allows guests to "perform" spells.

        <div class="page-text-heading" style="padding-top: 0px;"> Literature Analysis </div>
        Google Scholar and ACM were used to find the literature. Studies that were
        too general and/or looked at relevant environments or technology, like VR,
        but did not tie the research back to immersion or the effects of interactivity
        were rejected. Each saved paper was read and quotes were taken that pertained
        to definitions [RQ1], levels [RQ1.1], and qualities of immersion/immersive
        environments and interactive technology [RQ2/RQ3]. Quotes that defined immersion
        or interactivity, mentioned or implied levels of immersion, touched on something
        the authors thought contributed to or affected immersion or interactivity,
        and/or quotes that mentioned the effects of interactive technology on users
        or the environment were considered relevant. For any literature that looked
        to quantify immersion (i.e. questionnaires), because my research was looking
        for qualities of immersion, notes were taken on what aspects of immersion
        the questions pointed to rather than any qualitative results.

            <li><i>Realism and Suspension of Disbelief: </i>Social Realism is “how likely” the detail in the world would “occur in real life;” Perceptual Realism is not about believing the world you were in could actually exist in real life, but that everything about the environment you entered – the buildings, rides, food, employees, interactions, etc. – was realistic to the world being created.</li>
            <li><i>Fields of View: </i>What guests can and cannot see both influence immersion, noting that immersion was decreased if a field of view included details that were not “relevant” to the world.</li>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Defining Immersion </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        To be immersed in a physical environment is to be transported to a new reality
        that encompasses the visitor, both physically and mentally, though the use
        of physical objects and interactions that engage all the senses.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Levels of Immersion </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        <div class="page-text-heading" style="padding-top: 0px;"> Low </div>
        <ul style="margin: 0px;">
          <li>Not all-encompassing; the visitor does not believe that the environment
            could exist as a realistic world of its own.</li>
          <li>Closest to the reality the visitor just came from; they are still
            frequently reminded of that “outside world,” both physically and mentally,
            but will see a few elements that start to build a new reality.</li>
          <li>Minimal sensory input via limited details and interactions; the environment
            does not have the potential to engage all the senses.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Medium </div>
        <ul style="margin: 0px;">
          <li>All-encompassing feelings in most of the space; a majority of the
            elements help visitors feel as if the environment could exist as a
            realistic world of its own.</li>
          <li>Occasionally reminded of the reality the visitor just came from; this
            could be from external distractions and/or a lack of details within
            the space that attract attention.</li>
          <li>Frequent sensory input via an increased number of details and interactions;
            the environment has the potential to engage multiple senses at once.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> High </div>
        <ul style="margin: 0px;">
          <li>Constantly encompassed by the new reality; the visitor always believes
            they are in an environment that could exist as a realistic world of
            its own.</li>
          <li>Physically and mentally visitors only see and think of elements related
            to the reality they have entered.</li>
          <li>At least one sense that draws the visitor into the environment is
            always engaged; multiple senses will frequently be engaged at once via
            an appropriate number of details and interactions.</li>

        <ol style="margin: 0px;">
          <li>Consider the goal of the environment and what level(s) of immersion
            would be most appropriate.</li>
          <li>Establish your audience – visitors have different comfort levels with
            technology, may make repeat visits, and may have pre-existing emotional
            connections with elements that make up the environment.</li>
          <li>Balance the complexity of the environment with the amount of planning
            needed; the experience begins as soon as someone becomes interested
            in visiting your environment – do not make excessive planning necessary
            and create an easy planning experience for those who wish to do so.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Use technology to make all tools related to planning accessible
              from one place both in the planning stages and when visiting the
              environment.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Consider the longevity of anything placed in the environment.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Have the resources to update/fix objects as they break and give
              in-world reasons for why technology is broken if it cannot immediately
              be fixed.</li>
            <li>Prevent technology from feeling out of date by choosing devices
              that can be updated, swapped, or customized to fit the changing mental
              models and expectations visitors will have as technology evolves.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Animations on a screen can be updated as software improves.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Establish the world your visitors will be entering and the “lore”
            of that world – what is realistic to the world, what is the overall
            theming, and how much of that world do you want to be something new
            versus something visitors already have an established understanding
            of.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Make the environment something unique that visitors cannot replicate
              on their own (e.g. from their own home) by using interactive technology
              to create interactions that are realistic for that world, even if
              they cannot occur in “real life.”</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Giving visitors the ability to performs spells via wands.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Prioritize the effect the inclusion of technology has on the world;
              don’t just include a certain type of technology for the sake of
              using it.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Add detailing that helps visitors understand the world they have entered –
            this should include more obvious details as well as hidden ones that
            could be found through exploration.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Take advantage of the fact that technology is not static; objects
              can change for various reasons to add more detail.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A decoration could automatically shift in style depending on the
                time of day.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Minimize the impact of distractions (sights, sounds, and smells),
            especially ones you might not have direct control over (e.g. crowds),
            through the use of physical barriers.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Enhance the effect of digital interactions with physical objects;
              what visitors interact with and/or the result of those interactions
              should include something physical.</li>
            <li>Use interactive technology to involve the visitors to draw their
              attention to the reality being built and away from the reality they
              recently “escaped.”</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Walking past a window triggers a change in the objects visible
                in the window, catching a visitor’s eye and adding different elements
                to the world.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Use elements of the world to build a narrative and include interactions
            that both bring visitors into that story and allow them to have an impact
            on the story and/or world.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Allow visitors to trigger changes in the environment that have a
              lasting effect.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If there’s a Harry Potter spell that lets visitors turn books
                in a shop into birds, as the day goes on, visitors should see more
                and more birds flying around the shop and hear louder bird noises.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Move the narrative along via interactive technology – past interactions
            visitors have should remain relevant for the rest of their visit.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Create a personalized experience and make interactions relevant to
            those directly participating as well as those observing – a change in
            environment should help build the world for anyone who sees it.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Make different interactions, even within the same space, have different
              results based on the visitor using the interactive technology to lower
              the chances of seeing a repeat interaction.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Use interactive technology that captures motion; if a visitor
                makes a big movement, multiple elements change whereas a smaller
                movement only alters one element.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Allow for spontaneity during a visit and build an environment with
            enough space so visitors can choose how to move through it.</li>
          <li>Give visitors the opportunity to set their own goals and/or have access
            to challenges that result in a sense of accomplishment.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Incorporate multiple instances (this can include different ways
              of interacting to suite different types of visitors) of interactive
              technology; this also adds variation and prevents crowding around
              one experience.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A space has five holograms that have conversations and a visitor
                sets a goal to speak to all five.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Integrate the use of smartphones into the theming.</li>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>If a guest is in Animal Kingdom in Disney World, change the interface
                of the Disney planning app to be nature themed; if they are in Tomorrowland
                in Magic Kingdom, make the design more futuristic.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Give feedback to the visitor for every intentional interaction.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Offer engaging reactions based on the visitor’s actions.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A large animatronic could be more suitable to pop out from a hidden
                spot and scare someone momentarily while a character on a screen
                can show more facial emotions and movement when conversing with
                a visitor.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Test any interactive technology used in the environment to make sure
            there is no confusion or usability issues.</li>
          </li>Engage multiple senses at once.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Depending on the theming, interactive technology used, and visitors’
              actions, technology can respond with visual, auditory, olfactory,
              tactile, and/or gustatory actions.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Trigger emotions and create an emotional connection to the space.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Allow guests to interact with objects, characters, or people they
              might not normally be able to or to perform meaningful actions that
              otherwise would not be possible.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Use 3D (portable) projection mapping to bring loved animated
                characters, like Pascal the chameleon from a Disney movie, to
                life in a way that allows for his face to show emotions based
                on visitors’ actions.</li>
