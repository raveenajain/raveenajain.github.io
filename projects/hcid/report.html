      Accessibility Report

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Goal </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        To create an Accessibility Report for four pages of a given website (inclusive
        of the journey between those pages) against <i><a class="text-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">the WCAG 2.1 guidelines</a></i>,
        levels A and AA.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Tools </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Microsoft Word, Firefox (version 107), Chrome (version 106) Developer Tools,
        <i><a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a></i>,
        VoiceOver (MacOS Screen Reader)
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> The Process </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        <div class="page-text-heading" style="padding-top: 0px;"> Step 1 - Easy Checks </div>
        I began by checking each page against the <i><a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/">Easy Checks</a></i>
        guidelines to get an initial understanding of the website and the company's mission
        as well as an overview of the more glaring accessibility issues the site was facing.
        <br>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Step 2 - WAVE </div>
        Following a similar procedure as Step 1, I then navigated through each page
        using WAVE. While some accessibility issues were immediately noted in
        the primary section of my report, others were placed on a separate list in
        order to be further evaluated with additional tools.
        <br>
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Step 3 - Screen Reader and Manual Checks </div>
        While checks were still done page by page, the Screen Reader was especially
        useful in discovering if navigation between pages was simple or even possible.
        The manual checks involved using Developer Tools to inspect a page's HTML
        and confirm the cause of a number of the violations.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> The Results </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        In total, 34 violations were discovered; up to 5.9% of the violations could
        affect users with auditory impairments, 52.9% with mobility issues, 85.3%
        with visual impairments, and up to 94.1% with cognitive disabilities. The
        range of methods used was meant to help form a comprehensive list that was
        inclusive of Cognitive, Motor, Visual, and Auditory disabilities. The findings
        were organized by page and then severity. Inspired by other existing rankings,
        I developed the following severity scale considering usability and difficulty:
      </div>
      <div style="width: 100%;">
        <img class="page-img" src="../../images/charitySeverity.png" style="width: 60%;" alt="a description of the severity rankings using where 1 is least severe and 5 is most">
      </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Personas from <i><a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles">GOV.UK</a></i> and
        and <i><a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/">W3C</a></i>
        were used to help me better understand and express how the violations could
        affect real users with a range of disabilities. In the report itself, each
        finding was color coded by severity and included its location, the method
        used to find it, a detailed description, an overview of the violation, an
        exact list of the WCAG guidelines violated, potential fixes, why it mattered,
        and an optional screenshot from the webpage. Below is a template example
        of a violation:
      </div>

        <img class="page-img" src="../../images/charityFinding.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="an example of a finding, mainly including the sections used to describe the finding">
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> The Report </div>
      <div class="page-text" style="padding-bottom: 1%;">
        If you would like to see the full report, please send me an email at
        <i><a class="text-link" href="mailto:raveena.s.jain@gmail.com">raveena.s.jain@gmail.com</a></i>
        and let me know whether you are a potential employer or student looking
        to read it.

      var w = drops[item].clientWidth;
