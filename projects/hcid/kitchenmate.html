        Based on the given brief: to develop an application for the 10-inch Amazon
        Echo Show that encourages users to improve their "diets and [be] more mindful
        of the environmental impact of their food." A focus should be placed on
        following the User Design Principles.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Initial Meetings </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        A small group was formed to develop this application, titled KitchenMate.
        The first steps taken were to do some background research on the topic and
        then meet to discuss that research. One of my primary focuses in that initial
        meeting was to plan out a timeline. As the team was working remotely, most
        of the screenshots included below are from our Miro Board.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Research (Interviews and Naturalistic Observations) </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        To create a truly user centered product, interviews with potential users
        were conducted to inform our future design decisions. In order to allow
        the interviews to flow naturally, but to guarantee the range of points relevant
        to the brief was hit, semi-structured interviews were used. Before said
        interviews, the team met to confirm which specific topics would be important
        to cover and to write and refine a handful of questions. After the interviews,
        and naturalistic observations in grocery stores, were finished, each team
        member wrote down key points:

        <div class="page-text-heading" style="padding-top: 0px;"> Key Insights, Personas, and Future User Journeys </div>
        By looking for common trends and overlapping ideas in the data, our information
        was translated and scaled down to a more cohesive List of Key Insights. The
        following are some examples of user insights - looking at nutrition labels
        in relation to diet, struggling with plastic packaging when making purchases
        from grocery stores, and wanting to have a more tangible, positive result
        in order to stay motivated when forming new habits.
        <br></br>
        The Key Insights were incredibly useful in helping create Personas, for
        both primary and secondary target users, and Future User Journeys for each
        of those Personas. These User Journeys and Personas were not only important
        down the line when it came to developing features, but allowed our team
        to continually empathize with the varying needs and challenges we thought
        our users could face.

        <div class="page-text-heading" style="padding-top: 0px;"> POV Statements, HMW Questions, and Requirements </div>
        Creating Point of View Statements and, from those, How Might We Questions
        really helped the team move forward from brainstorming to refining ideas
        into actual features. Our team worked closely to figure out both what would
        be core to include based on what users had said as well as what was realistic
        and important to implement based on the brief. For example, multiple users
        mentioned wanting to buy healthier and more sustainable products, but struggled
        with the associated cost and the time it took to compare items in a grocery
        store. This turned into thinking about developing a tool so users could,
        at a glance, compare different items and make an informed "cost/benefit"
        decision; the hope was ease-of-use would help encourage users to buy healthier
        products, as required by the brief.
        <br></br>
        To help figure out how our potential features could be implementated, Functional,
        Non-Functional, and Data Requirements were tied back to the POV Statements.
        And, throughout the entire process, we made sure to empathize with our users'
        wants and needs and to refer back to our initial user research.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Sketches </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        The list of features to be implemented were divided into overarching, key
        categories; each team member then took the lead on a couple of areas (I
        focused on the features related to presenting recipes and developing a rewards
        system to motivate users). Low-fidelity sketching was used as a way of both
        brainstorming designs and efficiently and effectively communicating ideas
        between team members. (Only my sketches are included below.)

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Wireframes </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Mid-fidelity, annotated wireframes were built based on the sketches. As
        none of the team had experience with Axure, we decided to learn something
        new "on the job" and use this software. When designing, referring to the
        User Journeys as well as considering other edge cases was crucial; this
        helped the team understand how KitchenMate could be used to create something
        that would be accessible via both voice and touch while still aligning with
        the more typical, minimalist Smart Home interfaces. And when developing the
        touchscreen functionality, both tapping and swiping were used considering
        built-in Echo Show actions as well as existing expectations a Smart Home
        user might have. The work was divided amongst team members and the designs
        of key features were prioritized before any additional screens were developed.
        I also created a grid system and template page (for assets like buttons,
        text, etc.) for the sake of consistency. Below are a few of the wireframe
        screens I focused on:
      </div>
      <div>
        <img class="page-img img-border" src="../../images/km/wireframe1.png" alt="health and sustainability goals loading screen"
          style="width: 45%; float: none;">
        <img class="page-img img-border" src="../../images/km/wireframe2.png" alt="home screen"
          style="width: 45%; float: none;">
        <img class="page-img img-border" src="../../images/km/wireframe3.png" alt="recipe results screen with filter"
          style="width: 45%; float: none;">
        <img class="page-img img-border" src="../../images/km/wireframe4.png" alt="recipe with filter and health and sustainability details shown"
          style="width: 45%; float: none;">
        <img class="page-img img-border" src="../../images/km/wireframe5.png" alt="glass bottle recycling screen"
          style="width: 45%; float: none;">
        <img class="page-img img-border" src="../../images/km/wireframe6.png" alt="voucher rewards screen"
          style="width: 45%; float: none;">
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Clickable Prototype </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        The wireframes were then made into a clickable prototype. When making the
        clickable prototype, the List of Key Insights was used as a reference to
        know what features to make clickable in anticipation of testing the core
        elements of our application. These core features formed a story where the
        user would look for a recipe (filtered by their personal health and sustainability
        goals), compare the sustainability and nutritional information of items
        that the recipe required, and, later on, scan empty food waste (like jars)
        to learn if and when they could be recycled. You can <i><a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://6y0xma.axshare.com/?id=tmck23&p=postcode&fn=0&hi=1&dp=0">

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Evaluation </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Considering Smart Home devices are typically more minimalist, the team decided
        it was worth the extra effort to create a mid-fidelity prototype (over a
        paper prototype) for testing. Because we only had time to do one round of
        testing, this allowed for a product evaluation on a touch screen device
        and resulted in more detailed and nuanced feedback. To work with the resources
        available, the team used both in-person and remote moderated testing with
        target users (with a classic think-aloud protocol for both). A set of tasks
        framed by a Scenario that was inspired by our Future User Journeys was developed
        to help the user understand why they might be moving through the motions
        of each task, especially considering the testing was not taking place in
        a kitchen environment. For each participant, the results were added to Miro
        sticky notes, using colour to differentiate between positive and negative
        feedback so the team knew which elements would need to be changed as well
        as what should stay the same. Literal connections were drawn between the
        responses and frequency, effect on the product, and success rate were considered
        when prioritizing the results.
