      <div class="page-sub-header"> A Brief Summary </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        For my Interaction Design class, I had to work in a small group to develop
        an application (called KitchenMate) for the Echo Show to encourage users
        to improve their "diets and [be] more mindful of the environmental impact
        of their food." We followed the User Centered Design Process and each member
        of the team was involved in the following steps:
        <ul>
          <li>brief background research of the given topic</li>
          <li>preparing for user research</li>
          <li>conducting semi-structured interviews and naturalistic observations</li>
          <li>reviewing research and affinity diagramming</li>
          <li>creating a primary and secondary persona and a future user journey for each</li>
          <li>building a list of key insights</li>
          <li>writing Point Of View statements and How Might We questions</li>
          <li>determining all potetial screens and priortizing which ones were key</li>
          <li>sketching key screens</li>
          <li>building mid-fidelty wireframes that were made into clickable prototypes</li>
          <li>forming a scenario with tasks and testing our prototypes with users</li>
          <li>translating and prioritizing results from testing</li>
        </ul>
        Any decisions we made had to stem from our initial user research. We used
        Miro for a majority of the steps; having virtual, color-coded sticky notes
        was especially helpful as we were working remotely. Sketching was done using
        pen(cil) and paper, and we had a crash course on Axure so we were able to
        build the wireframes and prototypes. We ended with an app that allowed users
        to find recipes based on their health goals, see estimated nutritional and
        sustainability information for those recipes, compare nutrition and sustainability
        levels of food products, and scan items to see if they could be recycled. And
        to motivate users, we established a rewards system where they received vouchers
        for recyling and making healthy and sustainable recipes.
