      <div class="page-text">
        For my Interaction Design class, I worked in a small group to apply User
        Centered Design principles to develop an application (called KitchenMate)
        for the 10-inch Echo Show. Our goal, provided via the brief, was to encourage
        users to improve their "diets and [be] more mindful of the environmental
        impact of their food." Our first steps were to do some background research
        on the topic, meet to discuss that research, and to plan out a timeline.
        As we were working remotely, most of the screenshots included are from our Miro Board.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Interviews </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Every design decision we would be making had to be based off of our interviews
        with potential users. As we would each be conducting semi-structured interviews,
        we decided on the overall topics we felt would be important to cover,
        wrote a few questions for each, and refined them together. After all the
        interviews and observations were finished, we wrote down key points for
        each user we had spoken to.

        By looking for common trends and overlapping ideas in our data, we were able
        to translate and scale down our information to a more cohesive List of Key Insights.
        This was incredibly useful in helping us create Personas, for both primary
        and secondary target users, and Future User Journeys for each of those Personas.

        Creating Point of View Statements and, from those, How Might We Questions
        really helped us move forward from brainstorming to refining our ideas into
        actual features. We worked together to figure out both what would be core
        to include based on what our users had said as well as what was realistic
        and important to implement based on the brief we had received. To help with
        figuring out that implementation, we tied Functional, Non-Functional, and
        Data Requirements back to our POV Statements. And, throughout the entire
        process, we made sure to empathize with users wants and needs and to refer
        back to our initial user research.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Sketches </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        With a list of features we were looking to implement, we divided said features
        into overarching, key categories; each team member then took the lead on a
        couple of areas each (I focused on the features related to presenting recipes
        to the user and developing a rewards system to motivate them). We used low-fidelity
        sketching as a way of brainstorming and efficiently and effectively communicating
        ideas. (Only my sketches are included below.)

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Wireframes and Clickable Prototype </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        The next step of the coursework required us to create mid-fidelity, annotated
        wireframes and to make those into a clickable prototype. We divided the work
        and prioritized designing the key features first before developing any additional
        screens. I also created a grid system and template page (for assets like buttons,
        text, etc.).
        <br>
        As none of the team had experience with Axure, we decided to use
        this software over Figma and took this as an opportunity to learn something new
        "on the job." When designing, considering different scenarios beyond our
        User Journeys was crucial in helping us understand how our application could
        be used so we could create something that would be accessible via both voice
        and touch while still aligning with the more minimalist interfaces typically
        seen on Smart Home devices.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Evaluation </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        To work with the resources our group had available, we used both in-person
        and remote moderated testing with target users (with a classic think-aloud
        protocol for both). We developed a set of tasks framed by a Scenario that
        was inspired by our Future User Journeys. For each participant, we wrote
        out the results on Miro sticky notes, differentiating between positive and negative
        feedback. We drew connections between the responses and considered frequency,
        effect on the product, as well as success rate when prioritizing our results.
