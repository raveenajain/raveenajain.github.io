      <div class="page-sub-header"> Goal </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Based on the given brief: to design the Information Architecture of a web-based
        information environment. I chose the topic of fanworks with the goal of creating
        a website that could bridge the disconnect that forms within fandoms because
        of their spread across the internet.

      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Introduction </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        This was one of my favourite projects I completed during my degree; I really
        enjoyed organizing complicated information into something usable. While
        there were some restraints on the project (i.e. the number of wireframes
        and the word count), the approach was up to us to justify. For each of the
        following sections, I have included the corresponding deliverable (all were
        made in Figma) and snippets of my design justifications.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Initial Research</div>
      <div class="page-text">
        <div class="page-text-heading" style="padding-top: 0px;"> Interviews </div>
        Three Domain Experts were interviewed. This established that, while my topic
        was fanworks, fandoms themselves dictate which fanworks hold value. These
        experts also emphasized the importance of the ability to block/exclude certain
        filters/tags.
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Website Review </div>
        An informal review of the well-known fanfiction website Archive of Our Own
        (AO3) was also performed. AO3 was useful as a database and as a way of understanding
        how people customize their fandom experience through user-generated tagging.
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Overlap in Data </div>
        Overlap between AO3 and expert interviews helped make it possible to determine
        which elements were expected across fandoms and fanworks. And because fans
        shape their fandom experiences, it was expected to prioritize folksonomies
        over structured data (Rosenfeld et al, 2015, pp. 128).
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header">Domain Model</div>
      <iframe src="../../images/domainmodel.pdf" class="ia-pdf"></iframe>
      <div class="page-text">
        The overall goal of the Domain Model was to identify core concepts and their
        relationships between each other. I saw building off of the Hub and Spoke
        structure that focused on a “central concept” (Brown, 2011, pp. 80) as the
        best approach to accommodate the diversity that exists across fandoms. But
        these diverse elements are still interconnected, making Brown’s advice on
        “reducing triangles” a vital way in determining core relationships (2011, pp. 82).
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Sitemap </div>
      <iframe src="../../images/sitemap.pdf" class="ia-pdf"></iframe>
      <div class="page-text">
        Card Sorting (on Optimal Workshop) was used to see if potential users would
        be able to condense the 12 types of fandoms from AO3 (alongside others I
        had added). Due to the variation in fandom experiences, my hypothesis that
        this Card Sort might not help refine these groupings was correct. Noticing
        that the only entities in my Domain Model feeding directly into fanworks
        were fandoms and creators led to the use of the hybrid Hierarchical and
        Database pattern as the user would constantly come across “larger volumes
        of information,” and to drawing upon Spencer’s “basic shapes for drawing
        an IA,” especially her “part of a page” notation (Spencer, 2010, pp. 180-193, 247).
        <br></br>
        Before moving forward, Tree Tests (on Optimal Workshop) that incorporated
        filtering and covered all potential paths were performed.

      <div class="page-text">
        Because 50% of tasks were completed using the “Fandoms” navigation, which
        would link to thousands of results, that category was broken down so users
        looking to browse could have a more manageable experience. “Blended Results”
        exists for a similar reason; each category of result utilizes different
        facets and showing multiple on the same page could complicate the website
        for users. Creating this Sitemap allowed me to take the higher level concepts
        from the Domain Model and think about how they could be perceived from a
        user's perspective.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> User Journey </div>
      <iframe src="../../images/userjourney.pdf" class="ia-pdf"></iframe>
      <div class="page-text">
        Building a scenario helped clarify how a user might incorporate filters.
        The journey itself was meant to showcase four potential ways a user could
        find fanart. Because every user’s background with fandom is different, only
        including a preferred path would not showcase the range of options. However,
        what could be considered a preferred path based on number of steps and the
        specific attributes of the user as established by the goal was highlighted.
        <br></br>
        The User’s Thoughts were added to establish context and help emphasize why
        this journey might be preferred considering their specific background with
        the Doctor Who fandom (Brown, 2011 pp. 140). Inspiration was take from Caddick
        and Cable’s design of diamond shaped decision points and pointed rectangles
        for steps (i.e. actions) (2011, pp. 83). As they used a rounded rectangle
        for the starting point (Caddick and Cable, 2011, pp. 83), which in this case
        was the Home page, rounded rectangles were used to notate any page the user
        might reach. Making sure not to “cross the streams” (Brown, 2011 pp. 130)
        helped organize the elements and structure of the journey itself. When a
        user is making a more significant step forward in the process, they move
        from left to right, but actions that don’t offer as much change to what
        the user sees are typically stacked.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Testing and Annotated Wireframes </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        This section will explain how the results of the testing impacted each wireframe
        screen.
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Types of Testing </div>
        Remote, Moderated Tests with three target users were completed. A Click Test
        was also created and posted to Tumblr, targeting online users with a strong
        interest in fandoms and fanworks; 28 users completed this study. Questions
        were formulated with inspiration from Toub’s approach (2000). To evaluate
        structure, grouping, and labeling, the goal from the User Journey was used
        as a prompt. Questions about initial actions a user might take and what users
        thought clicking on certain elements would do/show were also asked (Toub,
        2000, pp. 14-23). The Click Test and Moderated Testing results generally
        aligned; a low success rate from the Click Tests coupled with similar results
        from the Moderated Tests made a change higher priority.
        <br></br>
        To prevent users from being biased towards clicking on “Fandoms,” this dropdown
        was not initially shown; for similar reasons, filters applied on Screen 3
        were unchecked.
      </div>
      <iframe src="../../images/ia_wireframes.pdf" class="ia-pdf"></iframe>
      <div class="page-text">
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Screen 1 - Home </div>
        All users during the Moderated Tests were able to vocalize what clicking
        on “By Fandom Type” would do, confirming this labeling choice. As users
        leaned more towards navigational breakdowns, future iterations could explore
        making “Fanworks” a drop-down through the use of Card Sorting to see if
        overarching categories related to medium could be established. Additionally,
        further testing would help determine the best options for the “All Categories”
        drop-down as results from the Moderated Tests were inconclusive.
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Screen 2 - Blended Results </div>
        While users can choose a category “to clarify their intent,” if they do
        not, because the results would not be “homogeneous,” they will see this
        Blended Results page (Russel-Rose and Tate, 2013, pp. 144). This approach
        was appropriate as there is no preferred path users should take as this
        site strives “to encourage [users] to engage in further exploration and
        discovery” (Russel-Rose and Tate, 2013, pp. 144). Moderated Testing participants
        indicated that they liked seeing this page as it made the results less overwhelming.
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Screen 3 - All Results </div>
        The default state of each filter would be collapsed due to their size (Russel-Rose
        and Tate, 2013, pp. 173-174). “Fanworks, Platforms, and Languages” use traditional,
        squared checkboxes as users might want their results to, for example, contain
        fanfiction AND fanart. “Fandoms, Warnings, Characters, Tropes and Genres,
        and Ships” use a hybrid checkbox and radio button. The circular shape comes
        from the radio button to imply that an element can be included OR excluded;
        the check and X come from the checkbox and are used to show that multiple
        elements within a filter can be selected. Moderated Test participants successfully
        recognized how these filters would work. Because the list in “Characters”
        can become long, to limit scrolling, pagination was added and the elements
        were ordered via popularity (Russel-Rose and Tate, 2013, pp. 150). Since
        the use of folksonomies and study of tagging on AO3 means the number of
        “Specific References” could be incredibly large, and considering Russel-Rose
        and Tate’s explanation, AO3’s “Additional Tags” option, and the importance
        of inclusion and exclusion, Search Within was used (2013, pp. 103-104).
        <div class="page-text-heading"> Screen 4 - Fanwork Page </div>
        Intrinsic, administrative, and descriptive metadata (Spencer, 2010, pp. 187)
        are all used and displayed to offer the user thorough information about
        any fanwork. However, inspired by the feedback from one of the Moderated
        Tests (the user felt there was not enough focus on the image), a Five Second
        Test could be used to see what information users are drawn to on this page
        (Booth, 2022) and then, once they have had more time to look at the page,
        ask them if that information aligns with what they value most. When asked
        where to find more information about the creator of this fanwork, 82% of
        Click Test participants clicked on “I_Met_DT” (expected) and 11% went to
        the Tumblr link. In the Moderated Tests, users went to “I_Met_DT,” Tumblr,
        or to Tumblr and then back to “I_Met_DT,” if unsatisfied. Future testing,
        could be used to determine if showing users a Creator page before this one
        would prompt more of them to remain on this website.
