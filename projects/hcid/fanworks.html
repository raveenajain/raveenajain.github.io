      <div class="page-text">
        For my Information Architecture (IA) module, we got to pick a topic to design
        our coursework around; if you know me you know it's not surprising that I
        ended up with something fandom related. And in this case I chose fanworks
        as my domain. While there were some restraints on the project (i.e. number
        of wireframes and word counts), it really was up to us to, as the brief explained,
        to "design the IA of a web-based information environment." While there are a
        number of websites, ranging from social to archival, that allow users to
        find and post fanworks, my goal with this design was to bridge the
        disconnect that forms within fandoms because of how spread across the internet
        they are. Aside from having a fun topic, I also enjoyed finding the best
        way to organize complicated information into something usable. For each
        of the following sections, I have included the corresponding diagram and
        condensed versions of the design justification that made up my coursework submission.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Domain Model and Expert Interviews </div>
      <iframe src="../../images/dm.pdf" class="ia-pdf"></iframe>
      <div class="page-text">
        I began by interviewing three Domain Experts and performing an informal
        review of the well-known fanfiction website, Archive of Our Own (AO3).
        Moving forward, AO3 became useful as a database and way of understanding
        how people customize their fandom experience through user-generated tagging.
        From my interviews, it became clear that fandoms themself dictate what
        fanworks hold value. For example, fanfiction is considered one of the most
        popular kinds of fanworks across a significant number of fandoms. But, as
        one expert mentioned, game mods cannot extend to non-gaming fandoms. I
        therefore saw building off of the Hub and Spoke structure that focused on
        a “central concept” (Brown, 2011, pp. 80) as the best approach to accommodate
        the diversity that exists across fanworks and fandoms. Overlap between
        AO3 and expert interviews made it possible to determine which elements
        are expected across fandoms and fanworks. Another core takeaway from my
        research was how fans want to both see and actively avoid
        certain content, as emphasized by the importance experts put on the ability
        to block/exclude certain filters/tags. Because fans shape their fandom
        experiences, folksonomies are often prioritized over structured data
        (Rosenfeld et al, 2015, pp. 128) on online platforms. As one of the experts
        stated, an unpublished fanwork is still a fanwork, helping me reframe
        how I thought about many of the entities typically associated with tagging.
        And considering how fandom elements are interconnected, using Brown’s advice
        on “reducing triangles” became vital in helping me determine core relationships (2011, pp. 82).
