      <div class="page-sub-header"> Introduction </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        For my Information Architecture class, we got to pick a topic to design
        our coursework around. If you know me, then it's not a surprise that I
        ended up with something fandom related; in this case, I chose fanworks as
        my domain. While there were some restraints on the project (i.e. the number
        of wireframes and the word count), it really was up to us to, as the brief
        explained, "design the [Information Architecture] of a web-based information
        environment." While there are a number of websites, ranging from social to
        archival, that allow users to find and post fanworks, my goal was to create
        something that would bridge the disconnect that forms within fandoms because
        of how spread across the internet they are. Aside from having a fun topic,
        I also enjoyed finding ways of organizing complicated information into something
        usable. For each of the following sections, I have included the corresponding
        deliverable (all were made on Figma) and condensed versions of the design justifications
        that made up my coursework submission.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Domain Model and Expert Interviews </div>
      <iframe src="../../images/domainmodel.pdf" class="ia-pdf"></iframe>
      <div class="page-text">
        I began by interviewing three Domain Experts and performing an informal
        review of the well-known fanfiction website, Archive of Our Own (AO3). AO3
        was useful as a database and as a way of understanding how people customize
        their fandom experience through user-generated tagging. From my interviews,
        it became clear that the fandoms themself dictate what fanworks hold value.
        While the overall goal of the Doman Model was to identify core concepts and
        their relationships between each other, I saw building off of the Hub and
        Spoke structure that focused on a “central concept” (Brown, 2011, pp. 80)
        as the best approach to accommodate the diversity that exists across fanworks
        and fandoms. Overlap between AO3 and expert interviews made it possible
        to determine which elements were expected across fandoms and fanworks.
        Another core takeaway from my research was the emphasis experts put on the
        ability to block/exclude certain filters/tags. Because fans shape their
        fandom experiences, folksonomies are often prioritized over structured data
        (Rosenfeld et al, 2015, pp. 128). And considering how fandom elements are
        interconnected, using Brown’s advice on “reducing triangles” became vital
        in helping me determine core relationships (2011, pp. 82).
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Sitemap </div>
      <iframe src="../../images/sitemap.pdf" class="ia-pdf"></iframe>
      <div class="page-text">
        I used Card Sorting (on Optimal Workshop) to see if potential users would
        be able to condense the 12 types of fandoms from AO3 (alongside others I
        had added). Due to the variation in fandom experiences, my hypothesis that
        this Card Sort might not help me refine these groupings was correct. My
        “ah-ha moment” was realizing that the only entities in my Domain Model
        feeding directly into fanworks were fandoms and creators. This led me to
        using the hybrid Hierarchical and Database pattern, as the user would constantly
        come across “larger volumes of information,” and to drawing upon Spencer’s
        “basic shapes for drawing an IA,” especially her “part of a page” notation
        (Spencer, 2010, pp. 180-193, 247). To confirm I was on the right track,
        I performed Tree Tests (on Optimal Workshop) that incorporated filtering.
        Because 50% of tasks were completed using the “Fandoms” navigation, which
        would link to thousands of results, I decided to breakdown that category
        so users looking to browse could have a more manageable experience. “Blended
        Results” exists for a similar reason; each category of result utilizes different
        facets and showing multiple on the same page could complicate the website
        for users. Creating this Sitemap allowed me to take the higher level concepts
        from the Domain Model and think about how they could be perceived from a
        user's perspective, making it much easier to create Wireframes later on.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> User Journey </div>
      <iframe src="../../images/userjourney.pdf" class="ia-pdf"></iframe>
      <div class="page-text">
        To tie into this website's primary goal, my user’s goal had to relate to
        finding fanworks, and building a scenario helped clarify the filters the
        user might incorporate. The journey itself was meant to showcase four
        potential ways a user could find fanart. Because every user’s background
        with fandom is different, I did not want to include only a preferred path,
        as that would not showcase the range of options. However, I highlighted what
        could be considered a preferred path based on number of steps and the specific
        attributes of the user as established by the goal. The User’s Thoughts were
        added to establish context and help emphasize why this journey might be preferred
        considering the user’s specific background with the Doctor Who fandom (Brown,
        2011 pp. 140). I used Caddick and Cable’s design of diamond shaped decision
        points and pointed rectangles for steps (i.e. actions) (2011, pp. 83). As
        they used a rounded rectangle for the starting point (Caddick and Cable,
        2011, pp. 83), which in my case was the Home page, I decided to use rounded
        rectangles to notate any page the user might reach. Making sure not to “cross
        the streams” (Brown, 2011 pp. 130) helped me organize the elements and structure
        of the journey itself. When a user is making a more significant step forward
        in the process, they move from left to right, but actions that don’t offer
        as much change to what the user sees are typically stacked.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Wireframes and Testing </div>
      <iframe src="../../images/ia_wireframes.pdf" class="ia-pdf"></iframe>
      <div class="page-text">
         I performed remote, Moderated Tests with three target users and created
         and posted a Click Test to Tumblr, targeting online users with a strong
         interest in fandoms and fanworks; 28 users completed this study. I took
         inspiration from Toub’s approach (2000) to help formulate my questions;
         to evaluate structure, grouping, and labeling, I used the goal from my
         User Journey as a prompt, asked about initial actions a user might take,
         and asked what users thought clicking on certain elements would do/show
         (Toub, 2000, pp. 14-23). To prevent users from being biased towards clicking
         on “Fandoms,” this dropdown was not initially shown; for similar reasons,
         filters applied on Screen 3 were unchecked. The Click Test and Moderated
         Testing results generally aligned; a low success rate from the Click Tests
         coupled with similar results from the Moderated Tests made a change higher
         priority. These wireframes have been slightly modified based on the results
         from User Testing.
         <br></br>
         <i>Screen 1 – Home </i>
         <br></br>
         As 2 of 3 Moderated Testing participants wanted to see new work from
         creators they had favourited, and as this builds a more personalized
         experience, a “Fandom of the Day” header was removed and “Some...Content”
         was added. All users during the Moderated Tests were able to vocalize what
         clicking on “By Fandom Type” would do, confirming this labeling choice.
         In the future, as users leaned more towards navigational breakdowns, I
         would like to explore making “Fanworks” a drop-down, using Card Sorting
         to see if overarching categories related to medium could be established.
         Additionally, I would do further testing to determine the best options
         for the “All Categories” drop-down as results from the Moderated Tests
         were inconclusive.
         <br></br>
         <i>Screen 2 – Blended Results </i>
         <br></br>
         While users can choose a category “to clarify their intent,” if they do
         not, because the results would not be “homogeneous,” they will see this
         Blended Results page (Russel-Rose and Tate, 2013, pp. 144). This approach
         was appropriate as there is no preferred path I want users to take and
         my goal is “to encourage [users] to engage in further exploration and discovery”
         (Russel-Rose and Tate, 2013, pp. 144). Moderated Testing participants
         indicated that they liked seeing this page as it made the results less
         overwhelming.
         <br></br>
         <i>Screen 3 – All Results </i>
         <br></br>
         The default state of each filter would be collapsed due to their size
         (Russel-Rose and Tate, 2013, pp. 173-174). “Fanworks, Platforms, and Languages”
         use traditional, squared checkboxes as users might want their results to,
         for example, contain fanfiction AND fanart. “Fandoms, Warnings, Characters,
         Tropes and Genres, and Ships” use a hybrid checkbox and radio button. The
         circular shape comes from the radio button to imply that an element can
         be included OR excluded; the check and X come from the checkbox and are
         used to show that multiple elements within a filter can be selected. Moderated
         Test participants successfully recognized how these filters would work.
         Because the list in “Characters” can become long, to limit scrolling,
         pagination was added and the elements were ordered via popularity (Russel-Rose
         and Tate, 2013, pp. 150). Since the use of folksonomies and study of tagging
         on AO3 means the number of “Specific References” could be incredibly large,
         and considering Russel-Rose and Tate’s explanation, AO3’s “Additional Tags”
         option, and the importance of inclusion and exclusion, I made use of Search
         Within (2013, pp. 103-104).
         <br></br>
         <i>Screen 4 – Fanwork Page </i>
         <br></br>
         Intrinsic, administrative, and descriptive metadata (Spencer, 2010, pp. 187)
         are all used and displayed to offer the user thorough information about
         any fanwork. However, inspired by the feedback from one of the Moderated
         Tests (the user felt as though there was not enough focus on the image),
         I would do a Five Second Test to see what information users are drawn to
         on this page (Booth, 2022) and then, once they have had more time to look
         at the page, ask them if that information aligns with what they value most.
         When asked where to find more information about the creator of this fanwork,
         82% of Click Test participants clicked on “I_Met_DT” (expected) and 11%
         went to the Tumblr link. In the Moderated Tests, users went to “I_Met_DT,”
         Tumblr, or to Tumblr and then back to “I_Met_DT,” if unsatisfied. In the
         future, I would like to show users a Creator page before this one to see
         if that information would prompt more of them to remain on this website.
