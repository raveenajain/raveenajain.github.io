      <div class="page-sub-header"> Project Proposal </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        For the final project of my undergraduate Human Computer Interaction class,
        a partner and I had to develop an application of our choice. After some
        brainstorming, we decided we wanted to create an app that helps young adults
        take better care of themselves, beyond just offering reminders to eat,
        sleep, and drink water. We proposed a more engaging and motivational
        experience by having users take care of an avatar, that acted as an extension
        of the user, to remind them to also care for themselves. Our process is detailed
        below, but <i><a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/raveenajain/BeeWell">
        the final prototype can be found here on Github</a></i>.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Conceptual Design </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        After submitting our projet proposal, we began by creating Metaphors and
        Scenarios for the User and for Sleeping, Eating, and Drinking Water. We
        also found and had a meeting to discuss visual inspiration.

        alt="colorful graphics of an aprtment with a kitchen and couch, iphone calculator,
        and colorful images of Tamagotchi land and a Webkinz room.">

        alt="colorful images of a Tamagotchi, a bee, the sims, Animal Crossing,
        and Stardew Valley.">
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Sketches and Storyboarding </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        After creating a Primary Persona, we developed our Scenarios and explored
        potential ideas by each sketching a proposed layout for our most important
        screen i.e. where the user gives the avatar food, water, and tells it to sleep.
      </div>

        <img class="page-img" src="images/beewell/rSketch.png" style="width: 35%;"

        alt="5 rough sketches formatted to a phone of a stick figure in a studio apartment">
      </div>

      <div class="page-text">
        We then worked together to combine our ideas into one to create screens for
        The Studio Apartment, showing a confirmation pop-up, and displaying a generic
        dialogue box. We also developed a rough storyboard showcasing how our app
        could successfully remind someone to care for the avatar and themselves.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Paper Prototyping and Wizard of Oz Testing </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        With a clearer idea of our screens, we then created paper prototypes and
        split up to perform tests with potential users.
      </div>
      <div>
        <img class="page-img" src="images/beewell/paperPrototype1.png" style="width: 45%;"

        to take care of an avatar and being reminded to drink water, eat, and sleep.">
      </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Before performing these tests, we created tasks to cover different functionalities: <br>
        1. Move through the welcome form screens, enter values for how much sleep
        you want to get and how much food and water you want to eat and drink. <br>
        2. Give your avatar water. <br>
        3. Change the number of hours of sleep you want to get to 9 hours. <br>
        4. Feed your avatar. <br>
        We then each took notes during testing and reconvened to, together, establish
        the following key takeaways:

      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> High Fidelity and Clickable Prototype </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        Using the feedback from our initial testing, we created a high-fi prototype.
        As required by the course, we had to make these prototypes accessible via
        a web browser, which is why we coded them using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Heuristic Evaluations and User Testing </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        In order to iteratively improve our product, we performed more user tests as
        well as heuristic evaluations (the "experts" were our peers from the course).
        From these tests and evaluations, we prioritized our results and made changes
        to our high-fi prototype.

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Final Product </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        After iteratively improving our application, we ended with
        <i><a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/raveenajain/BeeWell">
        our final prototype which can be explored in your browser</a></i>
        or can be viewed below via the demo video we created.
