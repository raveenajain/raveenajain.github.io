      <div class="page-sub-header"> The Initial Website </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        I initially created this website, from scratch, as a first year student at
        a hackathon hosted by my university's Women in Technology club. While this was
        a great intro to HTML and CSS, the site itself (both the code and the design)
        really wasn't the greatest.

          alt="grey version of the homepage of this site with red text">
        <img class="page-img" src="images/webArchive/v1b.png" style="width: 40%; float: none;"

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Discovering UX/UI Design </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        When I was interning as a Web Developer, because of my experience with Adobe
        Suite software (and the nature of start-ups), I was given the opportunity to
        work with the Product Team to create mock-ups and demos of our web-based
        product to show to potential clients. And thus I had discovered UI Design!
        As this work peaked my interest, I figured fixing up my website would be
        a good opportunity to explore the field further. So I decided to try and
        add some dimension and more complex elements to my site, expressed via a
        mock-up (using Adobe Spark):
      </div>
      <br> </br>
      <div>
        <img class="page-img" src="images/webArchive/v2.png"
          style="width: 40%; float: none; border-left: solid; border-right: solid; border-bottom: solid; border-width: thin;"
          alt="homepage of this site with navbar, red icons, and black text on a white background">
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Human Computer Interaction </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        While I never really translated my last design to code, I still wanted to
        improve my website. Eventually, I took a Human Computer Interaction course
        and was able to learn more about the design and development process, from
        ideation and sketching to prototypes and coding. I therefore wanted to take
        advantage of this new knowledge and use that process to make changes to
        my site. So I made sketches, explored some color schemes, and made
        <i><a class="text-link" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/43MN4O68AreV2vCPfuLedj/New-Website?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=min-zoom">
          a high-fidelity prototype using Figma</a></i>.

      <br> </br>
      <div>
        <img class="page-img" src="images/webArchive/sketches2.png" style="width: 29.8%; float:"
          alt="paper and pencil skecthes of home page of this site">
        <img class="page-img" src="images/webArchive/sketches1.png" style="width: 29%; float: none;"
          alt="paper and pencil sketch of the project page of this site">
        <img class="page-img" src="images/webArchive/colors.png" style="width: 31.5%; float: none;"
          alt="red, grey, black, and white color scheme and teal, purple, grey, black, and white color scheme">
      </div>

      <div class="page-sub-header"> Today's Design </div>
      <div class="page-text">
        I made some changes when transferring these ideas to code, but working
        off of an existing design was definitely helpful when coding this website.
        And while I've made some tweaks since then, for now, this was the process
        that got me to the website I have today!
        <br> </br>
      </div>
  </body>

  <script>
    function getMinWidth(item) {
      var drops = document.getElementsByClassName("dropHover");
      var w = drops[item].clientWidth;
      document.querySelectorAll(".dropdown")[item].style.minWidth = w + 'px';
    }
  </script>
